<p> <b>Profile </b> </p>
<p> I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2016 with a PhD in mathematics. I am currently pursuing to become a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA). 
Moreover, I have been working on a series of papers to practice the principles for data analysis, and inference more generally, laid down in <i> Probability 
Theory As Logic of Science </i> by Professor E. T. Jaynes (2003). I will post the papers below as they become available. I live in Mainland China, and I can be 
reached at fengzisheng@hotmail.com.</p>
